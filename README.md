I am making the first, only, and best Stat Tracker for Beer Die!

Beer Die is a game (sport) played by many a college boy, and
in the summer of 2021, when my friends and I would play every weekend, I created (to my knowledge) the first scoresheet for beer die.
We would tally stats on my computer, and at the end of the day, I would update a summer-long stat-keeping spreadsheet.
But now it is time for the real deal.

This is the command line version, to get all of the back-end stuff working. Stay tuned for the iOS app.

All work is my own.
